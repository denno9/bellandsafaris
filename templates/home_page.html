                <p class="text-start">
                    The southern protected areas (Ruaha National Park and Selous Game Reserve, plus Mikumi, Udzungwa Mountains and Kitulo parks) are receiving increasing attention,
                     but still don’t see the number of visitors that the north does and most areas tend to have more of a wilderness feel.
                     Except for Mikumi, they also tend to be more time-consuming to reach by road. The wildlife, however, 
                     is just as impressive, although it’s often spread out over larger areas. At Udzungwa Mountains and Kitulo, 
                     the main highlights are botanical.

                <p class="text-start">
                    Tanzania has 16 mainland national parks, 14 wildlife reserves, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, three marine parks and several protected marine reserves. Until relatively recently,
                     development and tourism were focused almost exclusively on the northern parks (Serengeti, Lake Manyara, Tarangire and Arusha National Parks),
                      plus Kilimanjaro National Park for trekkers, and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. All of these places are easily reached by road or air, and heavily visited,
                       with a range of facilities. Apart from the evocative landscapes, the main attractions are the high concentrations, diversity and accessibility of the wildlife.

                <p class="text-start">
                    In the west are Mahale Mountains and Gombe National Parks, 
                    where the main draws are the chimpanzees and (for Mahale) the remoteness. 
                    Katavi is also remote, and offers a wonderful opportunity to experience real wilderness. 
                    Rubondo Island National Park is set on its own in Lake Victoria, and is of particular interest for birding.
                     Saadani, just north of Dar es Salaam, is the only terrestrial national park along the coast.
                      Mkomazi, just off the Arusha–Tanga highway near Same, hosts a private sanctuary for black rhinos.
